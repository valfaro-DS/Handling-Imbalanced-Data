# Handling-Imbalanced-Data
Class imbalance is a common challenge in real-world classification tasks, not only because models trained on such data tend to favor the majority class but also because accurately predicting the minority class—the rare event—is often of utmost importance. Consider scenarios like fraud detection, where failing to detect fraud can result in substantial losses, or medical diagnosis, where missing a critical condition can be life-threatening. In general, it's crucial to maintain a critical perspective all the way through the problem and keep the objective in mind!

This notebook highlights the importance of questioning conventional metrics and tools in non-standard situations such us that of class imbalance. Metrics like Accuracy or the ROC curve can mislead us by suggesting overall model performance, masking deficiencies in minority class prediction. A few approaches will be discussed for dealing with class imbalance.

Here, we tackle a churn imbalanced dataset, where churn instances represent the minority class. Note that while feature selection plays a crucial role in model development, this notebook will not focus on it and feature selection beyond basic preprocessing steps will not be covered in this context.
